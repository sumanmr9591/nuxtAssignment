/// ## Import
///
/// **WARNING**: This module writes CSS directly to your stylesheets.
/// There is no configuration, no mixins, no variables, and no functions.
/// This module is not imported by default,
/// and does not require the core.
///
/// ```scss
///   @import '<path-to>/accoutrement/sass/init';
/// ```
///
/// If you're using [Eyeglass](https://github.com/sass-eyeglass/eyeglass),
/// you can leave off most of the path:
///
/// ```scss
///   @import 'accoutrement/init';
/// ```
/// @group init
